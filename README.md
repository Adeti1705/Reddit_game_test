🎮 AI-Kinator: A Reverse Akinator Game
🌟 Inspiration
We wanted to build a fun, interactive puzzle game for HACH-REDDIT 2025 hackathon. After rejecting several ideas, inspiration struck when YouTube randomly recommended an old Akinator video.

💡 What if, instead of answering, the player asks questions to guess a secret entity?

And just like that, AI-Kinator was born!

🕹️ What It Does
AI-Kinator flips Akinator on its head! Instead of the AI guessing, you ask yes/no questions to figure out the secret entity. The challenge? Can you outsmart the AI before running out of guesses?

🏗️ How We Built It
We used:
✔️ Google Gemini API for processing user questions.
✔️ Devvit (Blockposts) for simple Reddit integration.

We initially considered a Web UI, but due to time constraints we simply stuck with blockposts for a smoother experience.

🚧 Challenges We Ran Into
🔹 No Fixed Decision Tree: Unlike Akinator, our game required AI to handle unstructured guesses dynamically.
🔹 Finding a Free AI API: Being broke college students, paid options were out, and Reddit limits LLMs. We settled on Google Gemini since it’s free (for now at least).
🔹 Devvit’s Limitations: Web UI was tricky, so we kept it simple with blockposts.

🏆 Accomplishments
✅ Built a fully functional, engaging game.
✅ Implemented AI-driven responses dynamically.
✅ Worked around budget and Devvit constraints to deliver a fun experience.

📚 What We Learned
💡 AI-driven guessing is harder than static decision trees.
💡 Free tools can work if you get creative (shoutout to Google Gemini).
💡 Simplicity wins—blockposts made development smoother.

🚀 What’s Next?
🔹 More themes & categories
🔹 Multiplayer mode
🔹 Better AI response tuning

We hope Redditors enjoy playing AI-Kinator as much as we enjoyed building it! 🎉
